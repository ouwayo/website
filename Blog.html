<h1> Machine learning classification for field distributions of photonic modes</h1>
<p>The traditional paper-based system of keeping data was secured and reliable. 
However, technology advancement proved the limited access and idleness of data which is today the precious commodity everyone wishes to possess. 
In fact, the recent technology uses data and past information to instruct machines 
what to do through the use of statistical techniques which give computer systems the ability to learn from data, 
without being explicitly programmed.
 I read an article about Machine learning classification for field distributions of photonic modes; 
 machine learning techniques can reveal hidden structures in large amounts of data and have the potential to replace analytical scientific methods. 
 Also, explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions from any data.</p>  

From the article, to identify the phonic modes they used clustering method 
which highlights the patterns in unlabeled data and has revealed parts of hidden structures which have been applied to anomaly detection (outlier detection). 
Also, this technique of clustering can withstand the 3D electromagnetic field distribution data.
 In figure 4, they used silhouette analysis which is an interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data.
 On this figure, the silhouette coefficients for each sample are plotted as a bar in the x-direction with a length corresponding to its value. 
 The samples are sorted by their silhouette coefficients, with smaller values located at smaller y-positions. 
 Also, the red dashed lines on the graph indicate the silhouette score which ranges from -1 to 1 and for the higher value means 
 the object is well matched to its cluster and poorly to its neighboring and vice versa. 
 Also, when is 0 it implies that the sample is close to the boundary between its own and the adjacent cluster, 
 and negative values indicate that it's assigned to the wrong cluster.  Specifically, on figure 6c,
 they presented random distribution of data by small spheres, and each corresponds to the field energy density at their specific positions. 

<p>Through all these models and machine learning training, they used Gaussian mixture model clustering.
 Particularly, k means algorithms which they explained as a method of vector quantization for signal processing. 
 But then, an issue is that k mean assumes that the clusters are circular, and the authors said this might result in getting a wrong measurement 
 and imperfect prediction. Since to identify the centroid, clusters pretend to have the same center with these spheres, 
 which means any approximation error might mess up the next result. However, I couldn’t understand the formula, 
 especially variables, are not explained. In real life, this method of analyzing quantum digital signatures 
 could be used in spectral conversion in solar energy, biosensing, and vitro diagnostics.</p> 

Moreover, many of the formulas in this article lack clear explanation, but the results presentations are perfect.
 Mostly the authors explain the mechanism of them, but the variables implications are not determined before being used. 
 Specifically, finite element method (FEM) simulations, where authors say that “the matrix for the clustering algorithm is composed and used to perform the clustering itself” 
 (Barth &Becker, n.d). There is no methodology of correcting this matrix from photonic modes.  In conclusion, the clusters are well presented,
 and it’s easy to see the variations of photons and some 3D schematic which shows changes 
 on the field’s distribution data in xy, xz, and yz planes (figure 1c). The article can be found <a href=" https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-018-0060-1"> here </a>
